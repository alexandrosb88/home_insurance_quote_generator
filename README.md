## Description

A Java application that generates tailor-made home-insurance quotes and could be adapted for use with business products as well.

## Usage

The user is required to input the insured value for building and/or content.

Additionally, the user has the option to select a plan in which coverage components are automatically selected, while
retaining the ability to check/uncheck any specific coverage item individually.

The calculation of the limit of each cover is automated based on pre-configured rules.

Furthermore, the user has the capability to review and adjust contract clauses as needed.
Any contract clause that may not be initially included can be manually appended.

Finally, the quote is delivered in PDF format.
